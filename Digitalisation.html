          <br>A fully digital enterprise is a company that has
adopted a complete digital approach. Digital tools and technologies are used to
conduct all business operations. Digital technologies can increase performance,
“by cutting maintenance time and costs” (Wei et al and Spermic, 2019). Digital
technologies, such as Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things empower
companies to have a competitive advantage in the business sector.<br>
          <br>The digital economy has many security implications
that individuals, businesses, and governments need to consider. Some of the key
security risks associated with the digital economy include:&nbsp;<br>
          <br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Cybersecurity
threats:</b> The digital economy is vulnerable to a wide range of cybersecurity threats,
including malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other types of
cyber-attacks. These threats can compromise sensitive data, disrupt critical
infrastructure, and cause financial losses.&nbsp;<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Data
privacy concerns:</b> The digital economy generates vast amounts of data, and there are often
concerns about how this data is collected, stored, and used. There are risks
that personal data could be accessed or misused by unauthorized parties,
leading to privacy violations.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Intellectual
property theft:</b> The digital economy relies on the creation and distribution of intellectual
property, such as software, music, and other digital content. This can make it
vulnerable to intellectual property theft, which can lead to financial losses
and damage to reputation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Fraud
and financial crimes:</b> The digital economy is also at risk of fraud and financial crimes, such as
money laundering and financial scams. These crimes can have serious
consequences for individuals and businesses.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Disruptions
to critical infrastructure:</b> The digital economy relies on complex systems and networks to function, and
disruptions to these systems can have significant impacts. For example, a
cyber-attack on a power grid could disrupt electricity supply, while a
cyber-attack on a transportation system could disrupt travel.

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">1) What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</span>&nbsp;
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>A fully digital enterprise is a business that has
fully embraced digital technologies in all aspects of its operations. This
includes using digital tools and platforms to automate and streamline
processes, as well as using digital channels to interact with customers,
partners, and suppliers.
A fully digital enterprise may use a wide range of
digital technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies can
enable the business to be more efficient, flexible, and responsive, and can
help it to better understand and meet the needs of its customers.
A fully digital enterprise may also be characterized
by its use of data-driven decision making and a focus on continuous innovation.
By collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, a fully digital enterprise
can gain insights that can inform business strategy and help it to stay ahead
of the competition.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>To summarize, a fully digital enterprise is one that can use digital technologies to transform its operations and create value for its customers, employees and shareholders.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">2) What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</span>
          <br>
          <br>The authors identified the challenges enterprises face in managing their information security during digital transformation efforts, such as risks from cyber-attacks and data breaches. They proposed a new genetic algorithm approach to improve work efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain strong information security.<br>
          <br><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Cyber-attacks:</b> A fully digital enterprise is likely to be a target for
cyber-attacks, as attackers may see it as a more valuable target due to its
reliance on digital technologies. This could include attacks such as malware,
phishing, ransomware, and other types of cyber threats.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Data breaches:</b> A fully digital enterprise is likely to have a large amount of
sensitive data, such as customer information, financial data, and intellectual
property. There is a risk that this data could be accessed or stolen by
unauthorized parties, leading to a data breach.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>System disruptions:</b> A fully digital enterprise may be vulnerable to disruptions to its
systems and networks, which could be caused by cyber-attacks or other technical
issues. These disruptions could have significant impacts on the business,
including financial losses and damage to reputation.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Regulatory compliance:</b> A fully digital enterprise may be subject to a range of regulations
related to data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. It is important for
the business to ensure that it is compliant with these regulations to avoid
fines and other penalties.<br>
          <br> To summarize, it
is important for a fully digital enterprise to be aware of these cyber-security
challenges and take steps to address them. This can include implementing strong
cybersecurity measures, regularly reviewing, and updating security protocols,
and training employees on how to identify and prevent cyber threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

of expertise:</b> SMEs may also lack in-house cybersecurity expertise, which can make it
challenging to identify and address potential threats.&nbsp;<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>Complexity:</b> As a bricks and mortar
business transitions to a digital enterprise, it may need to adopt a range of
new technologies and systems, which can increase the complexity of its IT
environment. This can make it more difficult to secure and manage.&nbsp;<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]--><b>External
threats:</b> A fully digital enterprise is likely to be more vulnerable to external cyber
threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, and ransomware. It is important for
business to be aware of these threats and take steps to prevent them.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> To summarize, it is important for a bricks and mortar SME
looking to become a digital enterprise to carefully consider its cyber security
needs and take steps to address them. This can include implementing strong
cybersecurity measures, regularly reviewing, and updating security protocols,
and training employees on how to identify and prevent cyber threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">4) Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis'
experienced worldwide in 2022?</span>
          <br>
          <br>In 2022, the need for the energy transition has become even more urgent.<br>Compounding crises underscore the pressing need to accelerate the global energy transition.&nbsp;Events of recent years have accentuated the cost to the global economy of a centralised energy system highly dependent on fossil fuels. Oil and gas prices are soaring to new highs, with the crisis in Ukraine bringing new levels of concern and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to hamper recovery efforts, while citizens worldwide worry about the affordability of their energy bills. At the same time, the impacts of humancaused climate change are increasingly evident around the globe. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that between 3.3 and 3.6 billion people already live in settings highly vulnerable to climate change.<br>
